# CDB

> The task required a sort of DB realized in C language saving on .txt files. The DB must be able to execute the basic SQL operations Create, Insert and Select with one filter.

##### The project was realized by Giovanni Gobbi, Matteo Fiordarancio and Jacopo Lunadei. 

+ The lib1718_UNIX.c file is the source code for UNIX systems
+ The lib1718_WINDOWS.c file is the source code for WINDOWS
+ The doc_... is the summary document of the project, which explains how the system works. For further information open it or look at the comments in the code.

P.S. All the documentation is in Italian because the professor asked so :(
